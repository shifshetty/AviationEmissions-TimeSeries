The goal of this project is to analyse a public time series dataset and fit a suitable model which can be used to predict future behaviour. 
As part of modelling the series, we will do a descriptive analysis of the dataset and identify the most defining characteristics of the series. 
Based on our exploration of the series we will determine a suitable plan of action which involves identifying the type of model we want to apply and find a suitable set of models. 
We will explore each model's suitability to the series by parameter estimation and residual analysis. 
Based on each modelâ€™s coefficient significance, error metrics and diagnostic checking we will identify the best model out of the bunch 
and use this for forecasting the next 10 units of time.
In this project we will go through each phase of the time series analysis in detail, provide a justification for each choice made and present our results in the most effective way.

The dataset we worked on is the Aviation Gasoline CO2 emissions in the US from 2000-2024
